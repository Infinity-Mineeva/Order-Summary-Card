## My process

Opened the provided Design images in the `design` folder in Figma to just get an idea of what the dimensions for each of the elements were.

After that, tried to match the, as best as I could in HTML/CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

This was more of a review for me, as I utilized tools that I was familiar with (mainly Flexbox).


### Continued development

I like working with Flexbox, so in the future I'll take a shot at using CSS Grid instead.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - served as a lovely refersher for the basics of Flexbox. Definitely recommend for anyone.
